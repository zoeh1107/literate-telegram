# PS06 Shiny App
this Shiny app allows for the user to select regions to see temperature deviations from the 1921-2020 base line. The first plot is a scatterplot with axis of year vs temperature. The selected regions will show up as the boxes are checked.

The table shows the averages over months, years, and decades. The widget is a radio widget so only one of the choices can be selected at once.
